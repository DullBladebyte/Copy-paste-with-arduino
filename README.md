# Copy-paste-with-arduino

A script that allows you to execute the best functions (copy paste) using an IR remote and an Arduino.

Of course, this is just an example of the things that are possible with python-Arduino communication.
# How to set up
Plug in the wires from your IR sensor and have the data cable going to pin 7 (you can change that in the files).

Find your Arduino port and input it into the port file (if you don’t know how, google it).

Then open the print values software and upload it to the Arduino.

Open the Serial and press the two buttons that you will use relatively close to the sensor.

Then copy the two values and go to the ir.ino script.

Replace the “replace here for” sections and paste in the controller codes.

After that upload, the file and open the python script. 

Enjoy!
